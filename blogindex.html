      <p class="post-excerpt">Think of an array. It stores a collection of data. Linked lists are similar because they also store a collection of data. They store elements on behalf of client code. An array gets one large chunk of memory and each element is partitioned a portion of that memory chunk. A linked list allocates memory for each individual element (also called a "node"). A linked list gets its structure by using pointers to connect all its nodes together like links in a chain.</p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">An understanding of pointers is essential for understanding most programming algorithms used commonly today. On the most basic level, pointers are variables. Pointers are references to memory blocks that contain a stored value. They are used to reference a value <em>already</em> stored in memory. They are not the value they are referencing. They are not the memory block they are referencing. The value they are referencing can change and pointers can reference a new memory block at any time.</p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">In a statically-typed programming language, every single variable name <em>must</em> be bound to a type - integer, string, etc. - (at compile time by explicit data declaration) and an object (which is optional; if not bound to an object, the variable name will be null). Variable names can only be reassigned to another object of the same type. C, Java, and C++ are all statically-typed languages.</p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">The first problem with every question is how to communicate the question. Don't be cryptic. Fully and clearly explain every critical piece of information. Doing this by yourself before posing the question to other people will help you understand the question better, and may even lead you to the answer. Make sure both you and your audience have 100% clarity on what you are trying to solve.</p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">After spending some time learning both Ruby and JavaScript (with a background in Java and C), I can say that I personally liked learning Ruby more. However, I have not built any live projects with either language. Being such, I can only talk about my personal experience <em>learning</em> each language and not about their general usefulness. I learned both languages through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">online tutorials</a> and <a href=
      "http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>. In general, JavaScript is used for giving web pages responsive functionality and Ruby is used to make APIs. (In general) JS = Frontend; Ruby = Backend.</p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">Today is Father's Day. I am a Father. I <em>expect</em> my family to try to do some things to make my day more pleasant on this special day. Maybe that is selfish; maybe it is normal (but still selfish). Today we drove to my grandparents house (after spending a few hours at church, then going to my wife's grandparents house for lunch). They live a little over one hour away. I hate driving. I had work to get done, my wife had work to get done. This whole driving thing was a big hassle and I didn't care if my Grandpa was a father too, I just wanted to go home and finish my work. My sister wanted us to pick up her daughter and take her to our grandparents house (she couldn't go because she was busy. . . gardening).</p>

      <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/technical/t6-oop-vs-fp.html">T6 - Object-Oriented Programming vs. Functional Programming</a></h2>
      <p class="post-excerpt">OOP was popularized mainly because of its reusability. One programmer can start a project, creating classes and methods, and another programmer can finish the project without having to modify the original code very much (or at all). OOP is built off of the idea of blocks (objects) of data. Each object (piece of data) is characterized by the class it belongs to. Classes are like presets. They give their objects preset methods and pieces of data that can be used by those methods. OOP concepts are pretty easy to grasp because the real world is modelled this way. A "couch" is an object that could belong to the "chair" class.</p>

      <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/cultural/c6-values.html">C6 - Values</a></h2>
      <p class="post-excerpt">The best time of my life was when I was in my third year of college. I was working really hard on and learning a lot about things I was passionate about. I was really happy with the way things were going and how I was acting. I was always giving my best, and in return, I was getting the most out of my lfie and work. Some of the values that come to mind when I think about that time are accomplishment, self-respect, personal development, and meaningful work. In general, I always try to live up to these values most of the time. Some times I value free time or time with my family the most, but for the most part I like to focus on my work (while still having enough time with my family at nights and on weekends).</p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">Ruby classes are best explained by example. Let's pretend that you have a balloon. Your balloon has certain characteristics. All balloons have a color, a volume, and a weight (when empty). These three characteristics can be modeled by a class in Ruby. The color, volume, and weight of your balloon will be instance variables of the general balloon class. The general balloon class can be used to create several different types of balloons (with different colors, volumnes, and weights) for different situations.</p>

      <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/cultural/c5-stereotype-threat.html">C5 - Stereotype Threat</a></h2>
      <p class="post-excerpt">"Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group" <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_steele_aronson.html">(Steele and Aronson, 1995) </a>. </br> </br> Read that sentence again. Stereotypes often hold some bit of truth for some people. However, when people know that they being identified by a stereotype, they come at risk of confirming this stereotype and identifying with it. Most studies on stereotype threat are concerned with African Americans and college test scores. The stereotype studied is usually that black students will under-perform white students in academic challenges.</p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">According to the <a href="http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/enumerables/">Bastard's Book of Ruby</a>, "The Enumerable module provides a set of methods to traverse, search, sort and manipulate collections." This is a fancy way of saying that enumerable methods are methods that allow easy looping through arrays and hashes easily. They are short cuts were made to be easier to write and read. The best way to understand enumerable methods is through <a href="http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/enumerables/">example</a>:</p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">At Dev Bootcamp (DBC) students are required to <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html">pair program</a>. To receive feedback, first you must work with another person through pair programming. Pair programming has many benefits, least of which is developing inter-personal skills, teamwork skills, and technical skills (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2027:17">iron sharpens iron, just as one person sharpens another</a>). I love pair programming. I feel that I become a better each time I pair with someone. Not only do I grow more patient and understanding of other's work routines and thinking processes, I also learn to express myself more clearly, and finally I develop my technical abilities. When pairing I am forced to explain what I am doing and why to my partner so we can stay on track.</p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">While learning CSS I was completely befuddled by the display property. I tried to learn by doing. I fiddled around with HTML elements in CSS. Most concepts came naturally to me. That was, until I bumped into the display property. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp">W3 Schools</a> tells us that, "The display property specifies the type of box used for an HTML element." Simple enough right? Not for me. I tried to mess around with it and either my div wouldn't move or it'd move in unpredictable ways.</p>

At Facebook, 15 percent of tech roles are staffed by women. At Twitter, it’s a laughable 10 percent. For non-technical jobs at Twitter (think marketing, HR, sales), the gender split is 50-50."<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/women-in-tech_n_6955940.html"><h5>- Huffington Post</h5></a></p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">While learning Ruby I have been puzzled by the differences between arrays and hashes. Why use one or the other? According to <a href="http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/programming_books/ruby_tutorial/Ruby.new_Arrays_and_Hashes.html">linuxtopia.com<a/> the difference is small, "Ruby's arrays and hashes are indexed collections. Both store collections of objects, accessible using a key. With arrays, the key is an integer, whereas hashes support any object as a key." But this doesn't tell us when to use one over the other.</p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">Have you ever explored your <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">thinking style?</a> If not, it can be a great asset for you when trying to increase your learning capacity. My thinking style is split almost 50/50 abstract sequential and concrete random. Abstract sequential thinkers tend to best through working/being taught by with experts. Concrete random thinkers like to learn by doing. The intersection of these two makes highly competivie solo-players who don't like to repeat themselves (do busywork) and enjoy taking risks.</p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">I am almost done with unit 1 week 1 (U1.W1) of Dev Bootcamp. It has been very fulfilling to work through the challenges thus far. I've learned a lot more than I would have imagined before starting this journey. This week my cohort mates and I have learned about <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">version control</a> and <a href="https://github.com/blog/120-new-to-git">git</a>. These tools are essential for programmers. They make you a better team player and can help you achieve solo player stardom (in the programming world).</p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">I am a big fan of the idea of releasing products as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVPs</a>. An MVP is a minimum viable product. A product released that is not 100% done yet. A product that the consumer helps make better with feedback, bug-testing, and enthusiasm. Apparently, Dev Bootcamp (DBC) is a MVP. In my first week I have found typos and broken links in the curriculum. Want to know the cool part?</p>
