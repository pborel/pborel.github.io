      <h2>Another Typical Family Conflict</h2>
      Today is Father's Day. I am a Father. I <em>expect</em> my family to try to do some things to make my day more pleasant on this special day. Maybe that is selfish; maybe it is normal (but still selfish).
    </p>
    <p>
      Today we drove to my grandparents house (after spending a few hours at church, then going to my wife's grandparents house for lunch). They live a little over one hour away. I hate driving. I had work to get done, my wife had work to get done. This whole driving thing was a big hassle and I didn't care if my Grandpa was a father too, I just wanted to go home and finish my work. My sister wanted us to pick up her daughter and take her to our grandparents house (she couldn't go because she was busy. . . gardening). We left my wife's grandparents house and headed for my grandparents house. We forgot to pick up my niece. . . until we had been driving for 45 minutes. My wife called my sister and told her we would come back and grab my niece. I felt like my time was being disrespected. Sure, we forgot to pick up my niece, but I'm a busy guy. I have work to do. I don't have time to pick up this kid, much less turn around and drive 45 minutes back to get her so I can turn back around and drive an hour to my grandparents house (which I didn't want to go to in the first place). I was feeling pretty childish. I ended up getting upset with my wife for agreeing to turn around and get this kid whose parents were too busy gardening to bring her themselves (family-time be damned).

      <h2>How to Deal With it</h2>
      I didn't feel upset because I had to go see my grandparents or even because I had to pick up my niece (I love my family and it is always a pleasure to see them). I felt upset because my sister was not respecting my time. She made me feel like her time (gardening) was more important than my time (doing actual work). I had to take a step back and analyze my emotions to understand what was happening inside my head and why. I was really pissed off with my wife, but it wasn't her fault. She was being <em>nice</em>. I was being selfish. My sister wasn't consciously disrespecting my time. She just really wanted to finish her garden and saw an opportunity for her daughter to visit grandma and grandpa at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I could go back I would change my attitude. I wouldn't have blown up my wife for being nice (at the time I was calling her a "push-over"). I wouldn't have pouted and thought that today was all about me. I would have gotten my work done earlier in the week. It's important to step back and analyze our emotions before making decisions, especially in a conflict.
