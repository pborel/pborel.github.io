      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      Ruby classes are best explained by example. Let's pretend that you have a balloon. Your balloon has certain characteristics. All balloons have a color, a volume, and a weight (when empty). These three characteristics can be modeled by a class in Ruby. The color, volume, and weight of your balloon will be instance variables of the general balloon class. The general balloon class can be used to create several different types of balloons (with different colors, volumnes, and weights) for different situations.

      <h3>The (Exponential) Power of Classes</h3>
      If you were me, and you had one balloon that has a color, a volume, and a weight, then why would you care about a class of balloons with similar characteristics but different values for each one? I'm glad you asked. Pretend you are a balloon salesperson. You sell many types of balloons, but all balloons have a color, a volume, and a weight (when empty). You want an online ordering system for your balloons so your customers can easily purchase the <em>exact</em> type of balloon they want. You could make a Ruby class for a generic balloon. This class would allow you to make a new balloons easily, quickly, and consistently.
