  <h1>Gender Inequality in IT</h1>
  <h2>The Battle for Rights</h2>
  <h4>5/30/15</h4>

      "At Google, women make up 30 percent of the company's overall workforce, but hold only 17 percent of the company’s tech jobs. At Facebook, 15 percent of tech roles are staffed by women. At Twitter, it’s a laughable 10 percent. For non-technical jobs at Twitter (think marketing, HR, sales), the gender split is 50-50."<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/women-in-tech_n_6955940.html"><h5>- Huffington Post</h5></a>

      Without diversity creativity suffers. The status quo lingers on, with no new points of view to challenge it. This is why it is so important to involve different types of people with fresh ideas in the invention process. The tech industry has been primarily dominated by men for too long. If it stays this way, the status quo will continue and countless possibilities for a greater future will be lost. This graph shows the difference of female employment between over the years in the tech industry and other STEM fields:</br> <img src="../imgs/t4-tech-issues1.jpg"/>

      The amount of women employed in STEM industries are increasing, all except for technology. Why? Do women not like those types of jobs? Or does the tech field favor men in such a way that it turns away women, whether purposefully or not? <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/women-in-tech_n_6955940.html">The Huffington Post</a> explains that, "'In computing, the stereotype of male superiority has proved more stubborn. 'The number one thing holding women back is stereotypes,' Corbett said. 'The stereotype is that girls and women are not as good at math and science as boys and men are.'<br/>'There's evidence that by first grade, most kids already associate math with boys,' she said. 'This is just a belief most of us have. It's a reflection more of our culture than anything individual.'" Because of this, hiring managers (male and female) tend to view women as less qualified than their male counterparts for tech jobs.

      This is a serious problem for innovation. It seems the only way to fix this is through fixing our culture's mindset. The problem is not with women. The problem is with the way people (men and women) view women.
