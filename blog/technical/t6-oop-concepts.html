      <h3>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h3>
      OOP was popularized mainly because of its reusability. One programmer can start a project, creating classes and methods, and another programmer can finish the project without having to modify the original code very much (or at all). OOP is built off of the idea of blocks (objects) of data. Each object (piece of data) is characterized by the class it belongs to. Classes are like presets. They give their objects preset methods and pieces of data that can be used by those methods. OOP concepts are pretty easy to grasp because the real world is modelled this way. A "couch" is an object that could belong to the "chair" class. Every chair object has similar characteristics. Each chair has legs, a seat, is used for sitting, can be moved, has a color, weight, etc. OOP makes it easy for programmers to change data. This can be a blessing and a curse. Sometimes it is good to move a "chair" object. Other times you might accidently move a chair onto the the top of a set of stairs, which is a bad place to sit on a chair unless you want to go to the hospital.
      </ br> OOP executes line-by-line, but one line may reference a method that was earlier in the program. When this happens, the computer will jump from the reference up to the method referenced and execute that, then return to the reference line.
      <h4>Examples: Java, C++, Ruby</h4>

      <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
      Functional programming existed before OOP and is primiarily used in educational and research environments because it is typically more efficient at dealing with large amounts of data than OOP is. For a lot of programs, functional programming is shorter and more efficient than OOP. However, functional programming is not modelled off of objects, like our physical world. Because of  this, functional programming can be harder to think about. Also, functional programming is harder to reuse / use in a team setting because you can't have multiple people working on their own classes that work together like you can in OOP. In functional programming you have to have each person working on a piece that perfectly fits with the pieces around it. Functional programming avoids changing data. Instead it deals with mathematical models functions to model computation. Finally, funcational programming executes line-by-line from top-to-bottom.
      <h4>Examples: Pascal, Clojure, Haskell</h4>
