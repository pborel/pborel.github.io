      <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
      After spending some time learning both Ruby and JavaScript (with a background in Java and C), I can say that I personally liked learning Ruby more. However, I have not built any live projects with either language. Being such, I can only talk about my personal experience <em>learning</em> each language and not about their general usefulness. I learned both languages through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">online tutorials</a> and <a href=
      "http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>. In general, JavaScript is used for giving web pages responsive functionality and Ruby is used to make APIs. (In general) JS = Frontend; Ruby = Backend.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>Learning Ruby</h3>
      I <em>enjoyed</em> learning Ruby. I started with <a href="https://rubymonk.com">Ruby Monk</a> and spent a lot of time looking through the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org">Ruby Docs</a>. Ruby Monk made things clear and easy for me as a beginner Rubyist. I also attended meetups to help me get excited about the language and keep my excitement level up while learning it. I haven't explored the use of any <a href="http://webdesignmoo.com/2014/10-best-ruby-frameworks-for-developers/">useful frameworks</a> like Rails, Lotus, etc. But my experience to-date with Ruby has been smooth. Things in Ruby made sense to me as I learned them. The whole time I was learning Ruby, it was like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Yukihiro_Matsumoto">Matz</a> was speaking to my soul saying, "I know you loved Java, but Ruby is even easier to write, nicer to read, and more pleasant to use." I encourage anyone who wants to learn how to program or just add a new language to their toolbox to start with Ruby.

      <h3>Learning JavaScript</h3>
      With my background in Java, JavaScript wasn't too difficult to pick up (some say JavaScript and Java are completely unrelated, which is mostly true, but their syntax is similar in many ways). While learning JavaScript, I spent my days going through the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">codecademy</a> JavaScript course (which was recently added, check it out!) and the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com">codeschool</a> JS course. I really liked both, but the codeschool course was top-notch. Their video and cheat-sheet style was a perfect mix for me. Now I am learning JavaScript at Dev Bootcamp. I highly recommend JavaScript for new programmers, but for different reasons than Ruby. Ruby spoiled me. Writing Ruby, learning Ruby, and reading Ruby are all much nicer than doing the same in JavaScript. However, while learning JavaScript I was quickly able to do cool things that other people could see. I could alter web pages without them reloading and create animations and games on them. This kind of power does come with a price, though. In order to use JavaScript with web pages, I had to learn how to make and manipulate web pages. I had to learn HTML and CSS before my JavaScript skills had any real-world use.

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      If you are looking at a quick introduction to programming, I suggest going down the Ruby road. Ruby is great for making APIs for web application development, among many other things. However, if you are more interested in animating web pages and front-end development, it may be better to learn JavaScript first. Either way, learn them both. Only then will you be able to become a true full-stack developer. And even a little experience in both languages will help you work with different developers more effectively.
