  <h2>U1.W1</h2>
  <h4>5/1/15</h4>

    <h3>Overview of U1.W1</h3>
    <p>
      I am almost done with unit 1 week 1 (U1.W1) of Dev Bootcamp. It has been very fulfilling to work through the challenges thus far. I've learned a lot more than I would have imagined before starting this journey. This week my cohort mates and I have learned about <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">version control</a> and <a href="https://github.com/blog/120-new-to-git">git</a>. These tools are essential for programmers. They make you a better team player and can help you achieve solo player stardom (in the programming world).
    </p>
    <h3>What is Version Control?</h3>
    <p>
        Version control allows you to save your progress on your work over time so you can look back at what you did and revert back to those changes at a later date. This is important when working on live software products because if you release a new version and something breaks, you can just revert back to the previous release. It is like the "Save Game" functionality in a video game.
    </p>
    <h3>What is Git?</h3>
    <p>
        Git is a version control system that allows programmers collaborate on team projects, show off what they have done, get help from other programmers around the world, and (obviously) track changes to their projects. Git works with <a href="github.com">GitHub</a>, a free-to-use, cloud-based, version control service.
    </p>
    <h3>How to use GitHub</h3>
      <p>
        GitHub can be tricky to use. Let's just make a repository, clone it (save it) to your computer, and celebrate.
        <br />1) Go to <a href="github.com">GitHub.com</a> and make a free account.
        <br />2) Click on the "Repositories" tab.
        <br />3) Click "New" (green button, top right of screen).
        <br />4) Name your repository something relevant to your project
        <br />5) Copy the URL displayed at the top of the page.
        <br />6) Open Terminal (your command line interface)
        <br />7) Navigate to the folder you want your local GitHub repository to live in (a local copy of your online GitHub repo, used for making changes before showing them to the world)
        <br />8) Initialize your repo - type: git init
        <br />9) Add a readme - type: git add README.md
        <br />10) Commit your changes (committing is like adding your changes to your GitHub repo with a comment on what you did) - type: git commit -m "add readme"
        <br />11) Add a remote for your changes (don't worry about understanding this for now) - type: git remote add origin [COPIED URL]
        <br />12) Add your changes to your online GitHub repo - type: git push -u origin master
        <br />13) Celebrate!
      </p>
      <p>
        Congratulations! Let's review what you did. You made a GitHub account, created an online repository, cloned (copied) your online repo onto your computer, made a change to your local repo on your computer, and added (push) that change back to your online repository. You have made history.
      </p>
