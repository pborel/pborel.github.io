      <h3>Step 1: Clarification</h3>
      The first problem with every question is how to communicate the question. Don't be cryptic. Fully and clearly explain every critical piece of information. Doing this by yourself before posing the question to other people will help you understand the question better, and may even lead you to the answer. Make sure both you and your audience have 100% clarity on what you are trying to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>Step 2: Research</h3>
      Before you ask your question, research it. You will probably find that someone else has asked a similar question online. Even if you don't find the answer, you can understand your question better by researching it. If you are asking a question about hashes but you do not know what arrays are, then you are problably asking the wrong question or wouldn't understand the answer you want even if someone gave it to you. An understanding of arrays is fundamental when trying to understand hashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>Step 3: Framing</h3>
      There are three elements to a question: title, context, and problem statement. Your title should reflect what you are trying to get answered. Your title should be the gist of your question. The context should be clearly outlined. Do not make people guess about the specific situation you are in. Give an example of what you did and what happened as a result. Review step 1 for more help with framing the context of your question. Finally, your problem statement should be the actual question. Do not just list what you did and what happened. Ask a real question. People will often say, "I did x and y happened." That is not a question. That is a statement. What they meant to say was, "I did x and y happened. What is the correlation between x and y and why did I achieve y with input x?"
