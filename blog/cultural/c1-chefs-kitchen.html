    <h3>Creating Something Together</h3>
    <p>
      I am a big fan of the idea of releasing products as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVPs</a>. An MVP is a minimum viable product. A product released that is not 100% done yet. A product that the consumer helps make better with feedback, bug-testing, and enthusiasm. Apparently, Dev Bootcamp (DBC) is a MVP. In my first week I have found typos and broken links in the curriculum. Want to know the cool part? I was taught how to fix them in the first week. I was empowered to learn through making the curriculum better while I go through it. Dev Bootcamp founder Karim Bishay produced this <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">video</a> to talk about the concept of DBC being a MVP. I am excited to be on site at DBC San Francisco in just 8 short weeks. Learning from the curriculum and creating something with my cohort and teachers that will help us develop our skills and make the whole system better for future students.
