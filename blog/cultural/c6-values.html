      <h3>The Time of My Life</h3>
      The best time of my life was when I was in my third year of college. I was working really hard on and learning a lot about things I was passionate about. I was really happy with the way things were going and how I was acting. I was always giving my best, and in return, I was getting the most out of my lfie and work. Some of the values that come to mind when I think about that time are accomplishment, self-respect, personal development, and meaningful work. In general, I always try to live up to these values most of the time. Some times I value free time or time with my family the most, but for the most part I like to focus on my work (while still having enough time with my family at nights and on weekends). The most important one for me is meaningful work. To me, meaningful work isn't just working on things that change the lives of others in a positive way (though that is a huge part of it). It is also working on things that make me excited. Things I can spend all night working on without feeling drained. My recipe for a fulfilling life is working hard on something you love while still having the time to give to those you love.
