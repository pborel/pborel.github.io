      <h3>Pair Programming</h3>
      At Dev Bootcamp (DBC) students are required to <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html">pair program</a>. To receive feedback, first you must work with another person through pair programming. Pair programming has many benefits, least of which is developing inter-personal skills, teamwork skills, and technical skills (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2027:17">iron sharpens iron, just as one person sharpens another</a>). I love pair programming. I feel that I become a better each time I pair with someone. Not only do I grow more patient and understanding of other's work routines and thinking processes, I also learn to express myself more clearly, and finally I develop my technical abilities. When pairing I am forced to explain what I am doing and why to my partner so we can stay on track. When I have to explain what I am about to program and why out loud, I am better able to think through the challenge I am facing. This helps me really learn how to solve a problem because I have to explain my thought process to someone else. Pair programming follows the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck debugging method</a> mentioned in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer"><em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em></a>. Pair programming also exponentially increases the amount of fun I have while programming. I am a people person and I like to work with people who are on the same level of expertise as I am. It is fun to work together to complete a challenge. However, it can be frustrating to work with another person who has different experience, views, and thoughts about how the challenge should be done. When working with someone like that, I find it best to view the experience as a test of personal patience and grit.

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      After you pair with others at DBC, feedback must be submitted. You have to submit feedback on them, and they on you. Receiving this feedback can be eye-opening. I usually receive positive feedback. The usual, "You were a pleasure to pair with" or "You have a good grasp on technical skills." But there is also the constructive feedback, "You really didn't seem to understand this concept, I suggest you review the Ruby docs" or "You should work on explaining what you are doing before you code your portion of the solution." I recieved the later constructive feedback a few times. It made me realize that I tend to enjoy the company of another person while I code, but I also tend to jump right in and code my solution before talking it through with my partner. Of course, coding on my own without utilizing my partner's help prevents them from being able to help me think through the logic and refactor my code for optimal performance. <br />
      Then there is the writing of feedback. Writing feedback can be difficult. Sometimes you have a really good pair who was great to pair with on every level. You might not have any constructive feedback for them. Other times you will have a pair who came completely unprepared and all you have is constructive feedback, but it is hard to say "You came unprepared" in a gentle way that they will actually listen too. I find that I have great pairs much more often than aweful pairs. The biggest challenge is usually finding constructive feedback, not trying to find a way to be gentle.
