  <h1>C5 - Stereotype Threat</h1>

      "Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group" <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_steele_aronson.html">(Steele and Aronson, 1995) </a>. </br> </br> Read that sentence again. Stereotypes often hold some bit of truth for some people. However, when people know that they being identified by a stereotype, they come at risk of confirming this stereotype and identifying with it. Most studies on stereotype threat are concerned with African Americans and college test scores. The stereotype studied is usually that black students will under-perform white students in academic challenges. Even the quote above only references negative stereotypes, however I believe that this is also true for positive stereotypes (even though these are few). People often live up to expectations when those expectations are placed in front of them, forcing them to confront the expectations. If the expectation is excellence, people will usually rise to the occasion. The same thing happens when the expectation is ignorance, criminal activity, or immaturity.

      Armed with the knowledge that the way we think about people (which is almost always betrayed by the way we treat people) actually affects how they perform, we have the potential to increase or decrease the likelihood of success in those around us. It is better to be surrounded by successful people than unsuccessful people. It is best to expect success from those who surround us, helping increase their chances being successful because of our expectations.
