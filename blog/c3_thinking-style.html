      Have you ever explored your <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">thinking style?</a> If not, it can be a great asset for you when trying to increase your learning capacity. My thinking style is split almost 50/50 abstract sequential and concrete random. Abstract sequential thinkers tend to best through working/being taught by with experts. Concrete random thinkers like to learn by doing. The intersection of these two makes highly competivie solo-players who don't like to repeat themselves (do busywork) and enjoy taking risks.

      This chart lists the different thinking styles and their characteristics:

      Each thinking style comes with its strengths and weaknesses. I have noticed that the hardest part about learning programming for me has been (seemingly) worthless repetition. Both of my thinking styles don't like to repeat work they have already done. I hate repeating work. Learning CSS has been especially difficult because I don't want to play around with divs and spans for hours if I am just doing the same things in new ways over and over again. I prefer to use a project (a goal) to direct my path. Making websites for a purpose has really helped me enhance my CSS skills. Using a specific project to distract me, I have had a much better time learning CSS.
