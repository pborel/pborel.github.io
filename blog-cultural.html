      <p class="post-excerpt">The first problem with every question is how to communicate the question. Don't be cryptic. Fully and clearly explain every critical piece of information. Doing this by yourself before posing the question to other people will help you understand the question better, and may even lead you to the answer. Make sure both you and your audience have 100% clarity on what you are trying to solve.</p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">Today is Father's Day. I am a Father. I <em>expect</em> my family to try to do some things to make my day more pleasant on this special day. Maybe that is selfish; maybe it is normal (but still selfish). Today we drove to my grandparents house (after spending a few hours at church, then going to my wife's grandparents house for lunch). They live a little over one hour away. I hate driving. I had work to get done, my wife had work to get done. This whole driving thing was a big hassle and I didn't care if my Grandpa was a father too, I just wanted to go home and finish my work. My sister wanted us to pick up her daughter and take her to our grandparents house (she couldn't go because she was busy. . . gardening).</p>

      <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/cultural/c6-values.html">C6 - Values</a></h2>
      <p class="post-excerpt">The best time of my life was when I was in my third year of college. I was working really hard on and learning a lot about things I was passionate about. I was really happy with the way things were going and how I was acting. I was always giving my best, and in return, I was getting the most out of my lfie and work. Some of the values that come to mind when I think about that time are accomplishment, self-respect, personal development, and meaningful work. In general, I always try to live up to these values most of the time. Some times I value free time or time with my family the most, but for the most part I like to focus on my work (while still having enough time with my family at nights and on weekends).</p>

      <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/cultural/c5-stereotype-threat.html">C5 - Stereotype Threat</a></h2>
      <p class="post-excerpt">"Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group" <a href="http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/bibliography_steele_aronson.html">(Steele and Aronson, 1995) </a>. </br> </br> Read that sentence again. Stereotypes often hold some bit of truth for some people. However, when people know that they being identified by a stereotype, they come at risk of confirming this stereotype and identifying with it. Most studies on stereotype threat are concerned with African Americans and college test scores. The stereotype studied is usually that black students will under-perform white students in academic challenges.</p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">At Dev Bootcamp (DBC) students are required to <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html">pair program</a>. To receive feedback, first you must work with another person through pair programming. Pair programming has many benefits, least of which is developing inter-personal skills, teamwork skills, and technical skills (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2027:17">iron sharpens iron, just as one person sharpens another</a>). I love pair programming. I feel that I become a better each time I pair with someone. Not only do I grow more patient and understanding of other's work routines and thinking processes, I also learn to express myself more clearly, and finally I develop my technical abilities. When pairing I am forced to explain what I am doing and why to my partner so we can stay on track.</p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">"At Google, women make up 30 percent of the company's overall workforce, but hold only 17 percent of the company’s tech jobs. At Facebook, 15 percent of tech roles are staffed by women. At Twitter, it’s a laughable 10 percent. For non-technical jobs at Twitter (think marketing, HR, sales), the gender split is 50-50."<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/women-in-tech_n_6955940.html"><h5>- Huffington Post</h5></a></p>

      <p class="post-excerpt">Have you ever explored your <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">thinking style?</a> If not, it can be a great asset for you when trying to increase your learning capacity. My thinking style is split almost 50/50 abstract sequential and concrete random. Abstract sequential thinkers tend to best through working/being taught by with experts. Concrete random thinkers like to learn by doing. The intersection of these two makes highly competivie solo-players who don't like to repeat themselves (do busywork) and enjoy taking risks.</p>

      <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/cultural/c1-chefs-kitchen.html">C1 - Dev Bootcamp Culture</a></h2>
      <p class="post-excerpt">I am a big fan of the idea of releasing products as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVPs</a>. An MVP is a minimum viable product. A product released that is not 100% done yet. A product that the consumer helps make better with feedback, bug-testing, and enthusiasm. Apparently, Dev Bootcamp (DBC) is a MVP. In my first week I have found typos and broken links in the curriculum. Want to know the cool part?</p>
