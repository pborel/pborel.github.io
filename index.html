              <p>I am an aspiring software engineer, husband, father, and avid hackathoner currently residing in Lake Angelus, MI. I'm working toward acquiring my BS in Computer Science at Oakland University. This summer, I will be moving to San Francisco for 9 weeks to finish my full-stack web development training at <a href="devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a> (they have a pretty awesome program). I have a background in OOD with a foundation in Java and Ruby. I also possess a Certified Associate in Project Management. I love to blog about technology and work on cool projects that have the potential to help a lot of people.</p>

              <p>
                <h3>Am I looking for work?</h3>
                Yes! I need a job in software engineering: anything from <a href="#projects">web/mobile app development</a> to enterprise application development would be great! You can download my <a href="./files/phil-borel-resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume here</a>.

            <p class="post-excerpt">Binary search searches through a data set by comparing the middle value to the input value. If the input value is greater than the middle value, it looks at the upper half of the data set and repeats its search. If the input value is less than the middle value, it looks at the lower half of the data set and repeats its search. Because of this, binary search requires the input data to be sorted. Binary search is considered to be one of the most cost-effective searching algorithms.</p>

            <p class="post-excerpt">Think of an array. It stores a collection of data. Linked lists are similar because they also store a collection of data. They store elements on behalf of client code. An array gets one large chunk of memory and each element is partitioned a portion of that memory chunk. A linked list allocates memory for each individual element (also called a "node"). A linked list gets its structure by using pointers to connect all its nodes together like links in a chain.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/technical/p-t9-pointers.html">T9 - Pointers</a></h2>
            <p class="post-excerpt">An understanding of pointers is essential for understanding most programming algorithms used commonly today. On the most basic level, pointers are variables. Pointers are references to memory blocks that contain a stored value. They are used to reference a value <em>already</em> stored in memory. They are not the value they are referencing. They are not the memory block they are referencing. The value they are referencing can change and pointers can reference a new memory block at any time.</p>
