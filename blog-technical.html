    <p class="post-excerpt">As noted by <a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/110/BinaryTrees.html">a paper on binary trees by Standford</a>, "The formal recursive definition is: a binary tree is either empty (represented by a null pointer), or is made of a single node, where the left and right pointers (recursive definition ahead) each point to a binary tree." A binary tree is a pretty much just complex connection of linked lists. They are usually visually represented as an upside-down tree-like thing (think org chart or family tree). Binary trees are composed of a "root" node which points to the start (topmost) node of the tree. Each subsequent left and right pointers of each node recursively point to additional nodes which represent subtrees (just look at the picture below if that was hard to take in).</p>

    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/technical/p-t11-searching-algorithms.html">T11 - Searching Algorithms</a></h2>
    <p class="post-excerpt">Binary search searches through a data set by comparing the middle value to the input value. If the input value is greater than the middle value, it looks at the upper half of the data set and repeats its search. If the input value is less than the middle value, it looks at the lower half of the data set and repeats its search. Because of this, binary search requires the input data to be sorted. Binary search is considered to be one of the most cost-effective searching algorithms.</p>

    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/technical/p-t10-linked-lists.html">T10 - Linked Lists</a></h2>
    <p class="post-excerpt">Think of an array. It stores a collection of data. Linked lists are similar because they also store a collection of data. They store elements on behalf of client code. An array gets one large chunk of memory and each element is partitioned a portion of that memory chunk. A linked list allocates memory for each individual element (also called a "node"). A linked list gets its structure by using pointers to connect all its nodes together like links in a chain.</p>

    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/technical/p-t9-pointers.html">T9 - Pointers</a></h2>
    <p class="post-excerpt">An understanding of pointers is essential for understanding most programming algorithms used commonly today. On the most basic level, pointers are variables. Pointers are references to memory blocks that contain a stored value. They are used to reference a value <em>already</em> stored in memory. They are not the value they are referencing. They are not the memory block they are referencing. The value they are referencing can change and pointers can reference a new memory block at any time.</p>

    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/technical/t8-static-vs-dynamic.html">T8 - Static vs. Dynamic Programming Languages</a></h2>
    <p class="post-excerpt">In a statically-typed programming language, every single variable name <em>must</em> be bound to a type - integer, string, etc. - (at compile time by explicit data declaration) and an object (which is optional; if not bound to an object, the variable name will be null). Variable names can only be reassigned to another object of the same type. C, Java, and C++ are all statically-typed languages.</p>

    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/technical/t7-javascript.html">T7 - Learning Ruby vs. Learning JavaScript</a></h2>
    <p class="post-excerpt">After spending some time learning both Ruby and JavaScript (with a background in Java and C), I can say that I personally liked learning Ruby more. However, I have not built any live projects with either language. Being such, I can only talk about my personal experience <em>learning</em> each language and not about their general usefulness. I learned both languages through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">online tutorials</a> and <a href=
      "http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a>. In general, JavaScript is used for giving web pages responsive functionality and Ruby is used to make APIs. (In general) JS = Frontend; Ruby = Backend.</p>

      <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/technical/t6-oop-vs-fp.html">T6 - Object-Oriented Programming vs. Functional Programming</a></h2>
      <p class="post-excerpt">OOP was popularized mainly because of its reusability. One programmer can start a project, creating classes and methods, and another programmer can finish the project without having to modify the original code very much (or at all). OOP is built off of the idea of blocks (objects) of data. Each object (piece of data) is characterized by the class it belongs to. Classes are like presets. They give their objects preset methods and pieces of data that can be used by those methods. OOP concepts are pretty easy to grasp because the real world is modelled this way. A "couch" is an object that could belong to the "chair" class.</p>

      <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/technical/t5-ruby-classes.html">T5 - A Beginner's Guide to Ruby Classes</a></h2>
      <p class="post-excerpt">Ruby classes are best explained by example. Let's pretend that you have a balloon. Your balloon has certain characteristics. All balloons have a color, a volume, and a weight (when empty). These three characteristics can be modeled by a class in Ruby. The color, volume, and weight of your balloon will be instance variables of the general balloon class. The general balloon class can be used to create several different types of balloons (with different colors, volumnes, and weights) for different situations.</p>

      <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/technical/t4-enumerable-methods.html">T4 - Enumerables</a></h2>
      <p class="post-excerpt">According to the <a href="http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/enumerables/">Bastard's Book of Ruby</a>, "The Enumerable module provides a set of methods to traverse, search, sort and manipulate collections." This is a fancy way of saying that enumerable methods are methods that allow easy looping through arrays and hashes easily. They are short cuts were made to be easier to write and read. The best way to understand enumerable methods is through <a href="http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/enumerables/">example</a>:</p>

      <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/technical/t3-arrays-hashes.html">T3 - Arrays / Hashes</a></h2>
      <p class="post-excerpt">While learning CSS I was completely befuddled by the display property. I tried to learn by doing. I fiddled around with HTML elements in CSS. Most concepts came naturally to me. That was, until I bumped into the display property. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_display.asp">W3 Schools</a> tells us that, "The display property specifies the type of box used for an HTML element." Simple enough right? Not for me. I tried to mess around with it and either my div wouldn't move or it'd move in unpredictable ways.</p>

      <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/technical/t2-css-design.html">T2 - CSS: Display Inline vs. Inline Block</a></h2>
      <p class="post-excerpt">While learning Ruby I have been puzzled by the differences between arrays and hashes. Why use one or the other? According to <a href="http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/programming_books/ruby_tutorial/Ruby.new_Arrays_and_Hashes.html">linuxtopia.com<a/> the difference is small, "Ruby's arrays and hashes are indexed collections. Both store collections of objects, accessible using a key. With arrays, the key is an integer, whereas hashes support any object as a key." But this doesn't tell us when to use one over the other.</p>

      <h2 class="post-title"><a href="./blog/technical/t1-git-blog.html">T1 - Version Control and Git</a></h2>
      <p class="post-excerpt">I am almost done with unit 1 week 1 (U1.W1) of Dev Bootcamp. It has been very fulfilling to work through the challenges thus far. I've learned a lot more than I would have imagined before starting this journey. This week my cohort mates and I have learned about <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">version control</a> and <a href="https://github.com/blog/120-new-to-git">git</a>. These tools are essential for programmers. They make you a better team player and can help you achieve solo player stardom (in the programming world).</p>
